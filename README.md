# FSSH

A CLI tool for quickly connecting to SSH servers with an intuitive TUI interface.

![Demo](./demo.gif)

## Features

- Intuitive TUI interface for selecting and searching from a large list of SSH servers.
- Automatically memorizes and encrypts passwords, requiring password entry only once.

## Usage

```shell
$ fssh
```



## How It Works

1. `fssh` parses your `~/.ssh/config` file and lists all the hosts.
2. Users can search for and select the host they want to connect to.
3. `fssh` spawns a new TTY and runs the SSH client to connect to the chosen host.
4. If the host requires a password, `fssh` will memorize and encrypt it locally. The next time the user connects to the same host, they won't need to enter the password again.
5. If the host doesn't require a password, `fssh` will connect directly.
